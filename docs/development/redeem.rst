Redeem
======

First step is checking out the :doc:`Redeem architecture <RedeemArchitecture>`.

The documents here assume that you have a working knowledge of:

- `git`_
- basic terminal commands (`cd`, `ls`, `mv`, etc)
- a text editor (preferably an IDE such as pycharm)
- programming with an object-oriented language

..  _git: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials

If you're not familiar with python, you may want to start by checking out the `The Python Tutorial`__ or the many other
tutorials that are available for those familiar with other languages:

__ https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/

- `Moving to Python from Other Languages`__
- `Python for Java Programmers`__
- `Python for Ruby Programmers`__
- `Python for Javascript Developers`__

__ https://ochronus.com/a-rubyists-confessions-on-python/

__ https://dev.to/underdogio/python-for-javascript-developers


Much of the python part of the code base can be developed directly on a linux, mac or windows host computer
using a test-driven methodology which mocks the BeagleBone device interfaces and Redeem native code.

To begin, clone the Redeem repo:

::
    git clone git@github.com:intelligent-agent/redeem.git
